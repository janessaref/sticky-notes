# Sticky Notes 

In this project, Iâ€™ve created an application that takes notes! The user can write, save and delete the notes. It allows the user to keep track on any information, tasks, and/or lists they've written down, organize their thoughts, and type down anything that the user would like to store into these notes. They are able to save multiple notes and can view their previously saved notes at any time as well as delete at any time.
